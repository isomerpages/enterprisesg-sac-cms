The revised ISO 14001:2015 *Environmental management systems* and ISO 9001:2015 Quality management systems\*, two of the most widely used standards, have been published on 15 September 2015.
 
The new versions follow a new, higher level structure with standardized core text and definitions so as to make it easier to use in conjunction with other management system standards, with increased importance given to risk.
 
International Accreditation Forum (IAF) has endorsed a 3 year transition period for the implementation of ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 9001:2015. It means that ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2004 certifications will not be valid after three years from publication of ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015. The expiry date of the certifications to ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2004 issued during the transition period will correspond to the end of the three-year transition period.  IAF has published 2 informative documents (IDs), IAF IDs 9 and 10, available at {:target="\_blank"}, to guide stakeholders on the transition.
 
SAC has informed its accredited certification bodies on the transition arrangements for the two standards. Companies should approach their certification bodies for more information on the transition. SAC encourages companies to start early in the transition to the new standards so as to ensure meeting the deadline and not end up with an invalid certification.
 
To help the industries to prepare for the transition, SPRING will be holding a Seminar on the Launch of SS ISO 9001:2015 and SS ISO 14001:2015 on 15 October 2015.
