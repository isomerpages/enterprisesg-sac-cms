The SAC Assessor Enclave was held virtually on 5 November 2020 to highlight SAC’s achievements, update new developments in accreditation and share best practices with SAC assessors. SAC assessoes were recognised with e-certificates for their invaluable contributions to the accreditation programmes.  We extend our appreciation to all assessors for their continued support and commitment.
