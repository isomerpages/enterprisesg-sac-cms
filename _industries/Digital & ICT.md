![Digital/ICT Industry](/images/industries/ict.jpg)

Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) is an all-encompassing term, referring to communication networks, the internet, computing services, and various forms of digital content. The fourth industrial revolution, otherwise known as the Internet of Things (IoT), is impacting and driving digitisation across multiple industries today. 

Developments in ICT bear many implications for companies involved in manufacturing; one example is the possibility of autonomous communication between machines and systems now becoming reality. Elsewhere in the industry, technology is also increasing network connectivity. This drives developments in cloud computing, internet businesses, and telecommunications. 

However, increasing digital dependence also increases vulnerability to digital threats. As cyber risks become more sophisticated, companies have to implement and constantly strengthen cybersecurity systems to protect themselves and their customers. The Common Criteria is an international standard (ISO 15408) which testing laboratories may use to validate computer security products. ISO 27001 is another standard, applicable to Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). ISO 27001 stipulates requirements for establishing, implementing, monitoring, and improving ISMS – this helps organisations to counter threats of data theft and damage. SAC has accreditation schemes for conformity assessment bodies offering such testing and certification services, to provide added assurance and credibility for ICT companies.

The Singapore Standard SS 584:2015 is for multi-tiered cloud computing security, and specifies three different tiers of security certification for three main categories of cloud computing services: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Cloud service providers should consider obtaining the relevant certification to boost end-user trust and confidence.

Other conformity assessment services relevant to ICT include quality management system certifications. These enable firms to continuously manage quality and identify areas for improvement. Certification for the management of end-of-life ICT equipment may also be relevant to an ICT business, and demonstrates an organisation’s efforts to manage end-of-life equipment in environmentally sustainable ways. 

In Singapore, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and Infocomm Media Development Agency are the government bodies which regulate the industry, laying out specific requirements with regard to conformity assessment.

The following SAC accreditation schemes are applicable to the ICT industry:
