Singapore is a leading logistics and supply chain management hub in the Asia Pacific region. In addition, the logistics industry is a key driver of the local economy. Singapore is the premier global hub port and international maritime centre, with more than 1,000 tonnes of cargo being handled every minute. In 2017, the logistics industry contributed 7% of the country's GDP, and demand for supply chain management services is enabling logistics companies to develop a range of capabilities across various verticals.

Safety and quality are key priorities in handling the large volume and sometimes dangerous nature of goods transported by sea. Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) can provide the assurance needed, and some forms of accreditation are deemed mandatory by regulators.

Inspection bodies can help to fulfil many of these needs, from bunker surveys to hold and hatch inspections, as well as marine asbestos inspections. Testing and inspection may also be conducted on bunker fuel, to assess conformance to TR 48 specifications. Where relevant, businesses may wish to engage inspection services for cranes and other lifting equipment to verify their safety.

In the logistics industry, the most relevant forms of certification include occupational safety and health management systems, as well as quality management systems. Business continuity management certification may also be important for ensuring the quality of business continuity practices. Certification for standard supply chain security (ISO 28000) is an industry-specific form of accreditation that adds value to your business.

The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) has accreditation schemes for Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) providing the services outlined above. These help to instil a higher level of trust in the accuracy and quality of conformity assessment results.

The following SAC accreditation schemes are applicable to the Logistics industry:
