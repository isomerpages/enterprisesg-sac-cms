Singapore is a global offshore and marine hub, with strong growth prospects for Marine and Offshore (M&O) engineering companies. Singapore businesses service worldwide demand for ship repair, shipbuilding, rig-building and offshore engineering. In addition, there is a thriving business in oilfield equipment manufacturing, as well as the building and chartering of offshore supply vessels.

Singapore is also well-placed to become Asia's Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) hub, and is positioned to take advantage of the growing demand.

Companies in both fields can benefit from strong accreditation standards, provided by Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs).  The CABs accredited by the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) provide added confidence regarding the quality of their services.

CABs assist companies involved in LNG with services such as offshore non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural inspection. SAC also provides accreditation schemes for inspection bodies (IBs) to provide services such as M&O inspection of air receivers, power boilers, storage tanks, and pressure relief valves.

In the testing fields, calibration and measurement of equipment and parts can be conducted by SAC-accredited laboratories, in accordance with electrical and NDT needs.

M&O companies will also find management systems certifications to be invaluable to their businesses, in terms of optimising operations and for demonstrating quality management systems.

Some examples of applicable management systems certifications are quality management (ISO 9001), environmental management (ISO 14001) and occupational safety and health (ISO 45001).
